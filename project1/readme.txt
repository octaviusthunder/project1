PROTECT THE CAKE 

There is a slice of cake sitting on a counter below a window. Assorted insects scroll down the screen.
The cursor is a hammer. Upon clicking, the background becomes cracked, while killing any insect within 5px.
If you kill an ant you get a point, if you kill a lady bug or caterpillar you lose the game. Once an ant lands on the
cake it stays there. If 6 land on the cake covering visibility, game is over.
If you kill anything other than a ant, the game is over. Other insects will be ladybugs and caterpillars.
They continue to scroll off the page and do not go to the cake.

Upon pressing the start button bugs will begin to scroll down the central window in rows, different amounts each time.
All characters will be represented by emojis to save time coding. Upon clicking each ant the hammer will leave a 
mark that will stay imprinted on the background and remove the ant emoji. If the ladybug or catterpillar is clicked the motion and ability to click
will stop and GAME OVER will be shown in the view window.
